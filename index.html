<h1>Back when Loop’s founder (Wasim Abu Salem) was at the age of 13, he really wanted to learn about technology and business. He has dreamt of building his future technological startup aspiring to achieve great success. Wasim did not find the required environment and business support to build his skill set. Therefore, he concluded that he has to create a solution for the next generations that will most likely look for similar support. In his teenage years, he’d always think about providing an alternative school system that is not old-fashioned, but a more modern one. Therefore, with his passion for business, technology, and the understanding of the need for a change to the education system, he began his long process, with design and careful thinking towards his initiative, which eventually became Loop in 2015; an impact-driven technological organization that is built to last (Watch the story behind Loop).
