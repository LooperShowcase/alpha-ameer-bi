   Loop and Secretary of State
   It was a privilege to have Loop's Founder, Wasim Abu Salem, meet with the honorable Secretary of State, Mr. Antony J. Blinken, and to continue building upon the strong partnership between Loop and the United States government.


   We extend our heartfelt gratitude for the ongoing support and recognition provided by the U.S. Embassy and State Department.


   We are proud and thrilled that the U.S. government has supported us for more than seven years, enabling Loop to expand its operations locally and globally.


   We look forward to further strengthening this relationship and providing even more students with the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed through our programs.
